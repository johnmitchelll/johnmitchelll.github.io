                Connect Four seems like an easy enough game, but there is actually a fair amount of strategy involved.
                This AI that I made using the MiniMax algorithm looks into future possiblities to formulate a strategy. 
                Its goal is to minimize its oponents maximum gain, hence MiniMax.<br><br>
  
                This AI isnt perfect and sometimes it will make moves that don't make too much sense. But out of the hundreds of games
                I've played against it I have only won a handful of times or tied. See if you can do any better against it. This 
                was one of my first projects I made back in highschool and was a huge stepping stone for my learning of JS.

              They can see the horizontal distance to the next pole (green) and the vertical height to the top and bottom of the 
              next pole (blue and red). This works well with something as simple as Flappy Bird because of the minimal complexity. 
              This is one of the most simple versions of what people consider AI today and is a great visualization as to what 
              simulated integligence is. -->
