              Graphing calculators have always fascinated me, so one day, during a cross-country flight, 
              I decided to challenge myself by coding one from scratch. I managed to get some basic 
              functionality working, but it was pretty underwhelming. When I got home, I took a deeper 
              dive into how these calculators work, and I was hooked. Over the next few months, 
              I dedicated countless hours to refining the project, striving to make it as close 
              to the real thing as possible.<br><br>

              That’s not to say it’s perfect—it can only graph functions in terms of "x," 
              and tools like Desmos certainly do it better. However, it was incredibly rewarding 
              to have a project I could actually use in my Calculus courses. I even added an easy-to-use 
              integral and derivative mode, which provides quick visualizations and helps with
               understanding the behavior of functions.

            The second part of this project, "Graphing Series," came about after showing my Calc II 
            professor the original version. He suggested creating a visualization for series. With 
            this feature, you can input a function in terms of "n" and a range, then increase "n" 
            to watch the series converge (or not). For an extra layer of fun, you can use the variable 
            "j" in a function to add animation. This works because "j" is a global variable that 
            continuously increments from zero when the program starts, allowing for dynamic and playful visualizations.
