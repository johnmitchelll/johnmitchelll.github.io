              This is by far the biggest and best project I’ve created so far. 
              It’s a full-stack application featuring a working database for 
              user profiles and real-time leaderboards. The backend handles 
              traffic, user creation, and profile editing. It also includes 
              a Poker AI you can play against in heads-up matches, functioning 
              multiplayer to compete with friends online, competitive slots, 
              and a variation of Texas Hold'em called Kuhn Poker.<br><br>

              I started this project out of my love for poker. Initially, 
              I just wanted to build a Poker AI, but it evolved into something 
              my friends and I could enjoy together, challenging each other to 
              beat high scores. This project taught me so much about web 
              development, and it’s been incredibly rewarding to see it all come together.

              <!-- The second part of this project (Graphing Series) came about after I showed my Calc II proffesor this and he 
              asked me to create a visualization for series. You input a function in terms of "n" and and an area, you can then 
              increase n and watch as the series converges or not. Also, for some extra fun, if you use the varible "j" anywhere in a funciton
              you can animate things. This is because j is a global varible that is constanly increasing starting from zero when the program starts. -->
