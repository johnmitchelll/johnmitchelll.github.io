              Wordle immediately captured my attention as a computer science enthusiast, 
              and I knew I had to "solve" the game. What you're looking at is actually 
              my third attempt to create a bot capable of solving Wordle perfectly. I 
              was determined to build a bot that could guarantee a solution to any word, 
              so when my earlier attempts fell short, I started from scratch.<br><br>

              This bot uses the official Wordle word list, and you can watch it solve 
              every word available if you’d like. The way it works is by analyzing the 
              list of possible correct answers and then selecting the word that would 
              narrow down that list the most. It plays that word, repeating the process 
              until the solution is found. While the concept sounds simple, implementing 
              it was a challenge. And, of course, the entire project is written in vanilla 
              JavaScript, with a little HTML and CSS for the interface.

              asked me to create a visualization for series. You input a function in terms of "n" and and an area, you can then 
              increase n and watch as the series converges or not. Also, for some extra fun, if you use the varible "j" anywhere in a funciton
              you can animate things. This is because j is a global varible that is constanly increasing starting from zero when the program starts. -->
