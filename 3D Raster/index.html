              3D always felt just out of reach for me creatively. This is my fifth or sixth attempt 
              at a 3D renderer, but after taking my first Linear Algebra class at ASU, everything 
              finally made sense. What used to feel overwhelming started to click, and breaking the 
              project into smaller tasks made it much more manageable. <br><br>

              I built a fully functional camera system with movement, rotation, and zoom, along 
              with basic lighting to add depth. The renderer supports .obj and .tri file uploads, 
              making it easy to view external 3D models. Right now, it only works on desktop sorry, 
              mobile users but it’s been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve built.

              <!-- The second part of this project (Graphing Series) came about after I showed my Calc II proffesor this and he 
              asked me to create a visualization for series. You input a function in terms of "n" and and an area, you can then 
              increase n and watch as the series converges or not. Also, for some extra fun, if you use the varible "j" anywhere in a funciton
              you can animate things. This is because j is a global varible that is constanly increasing starting from zero when the program starts. -->
