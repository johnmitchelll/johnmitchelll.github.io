        <p>This is my neural network I built from scratch in vanilla JavaScript. You can watch the birds getting better and 
            better as they learn how to fly through the pipes. The "learning" comes from the genetic algorithm under the hood. 
            More specificly this project uses NEAT (Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies).<br><br>

            We take an initial population of birds with completely randomized brains and let them out into the world. Majority 
            of the time these birds are very dumb. After all the birds have crashed, we take the best birds brain and duplicate 
            it into the other birds before mutating it slightly. This will ensure that through random evolution the birds will 
            get better overtime.<br><br>

            Each one of these bird's brains take in three bits of information and can make one decision: to jump, or not jump.
            They can see the horizontal distance to the next pole (green) and the vertical height to the top and bottom of the 
            next pole (blue and red). This works well with something as simple as Flappy Bird because of the minimal complexity. 
            This is one of the most simple versions of what people consider AI today and is a great visualization as to what 
            simulated integligence is.
