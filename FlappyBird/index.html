              This is a neural network I built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript. 
              You can watch the birds gradually improve as they learn to navigate through 
              the pipes. The "learning" is powered by a genetic algorithm under the hood,
               specifically using NEAT (Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies).<br><br>

              The process starts with a population of birds that have completely randomized brains 
              and sets them loose in the world. Most of the time, these birds behave quite poorly. 
              Once all the birds have crashed, the brain of the best-performing bird is duplicated 
              across the population, with slight mutations applied. This ensures that, through random 
              evolution, the birds improve over time.

            Each bird's brain processes three pieces of information and makes one decision:
             to jump or not to jump. They "see" the horizontal distance to the next pole 
             (green) and the vertical distances to the top and bottom of the next pole 
             (blue and red). This simplicity works perfectly for something like Flappy 
             'Bird due to its minimal complexity. It's a basic example of what people 
             today often refer to as AI and provides a great visualization of simulated 
             intelligence in action.
